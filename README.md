# Educational Platform

## Description

The Educational Platform is a web application designed for users to create, manage, and access educational courses and lessons. Users must sign up and log in to utilize the platform's features. The platform includes course and lesson management functionalities, a search feature to find users, courses, and lessons, and leverages Redis for quick data retrieval.

First, the user will sign up, and after all validations are successfully checked, the user will be redirected to the login page, where authentication will take place. After logging in, a JWT token will be generated, which will be stored in cookies. Then, when the user is redirected to the home page, their verification will be done using the JWT token from the cookies. After that, the user can add, view, update (patch), or delete courses and perform CRUD operations with lessons as well. However, whenever a GET operation is performed, the data will first be fetched from the Redis server. If the data is found there, it will be returned to the user. If not, the request will go to the controller, where the data will be fetched from the database and also stored in the Redis server for faster access next time. The data in the Redis server will expire every 1 minute, so any updates made in the database will also reflect in the Redis server. Lastly, thereâ€™s a search endpoint that allows the user to search by their name, search for courses by title, and search for lessons by their title.user also able to logout itself.

-[note-user will logged in  only for 1hr after it  automatically logout because cookies will expire in 1hr]

```
## Environment Variables
- [Make sure to create a .env file in the root of your project with the following variables:]

makefile
Copy code
PORT=4500
DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>

## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - Users can sign up and log in using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization. Only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.

-**Data Validation**:
 -User input is validated using Express Validator during the signup process to ensure data integrity.

-**password security**:
-Passwords are securely hashed using Bcrypt to protect user credentials.

- **Course Management**:
  - Create new courses.
  - View all courses or filter to see only user-created courses.
  - Update existing courses.
  - Delete courses.

- **Lesson Management**:
  - Create new lessons.
  - View all lessons or filter to see only user-created lessons.
  - Update existing lessons.
  - Delete lessons.

- **Search Functionality**:
  - Search for users by name.
  - Search for courses by title.
  - Search for lessons by title.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**:
  - Utilizes EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering on the server.

- **Data Storage**:
  - User data is cached in a Redis server for quick access during data retrieval.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building web applications in Node.js.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for server-side rendering of HTML.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user, course, and lesson data.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching user data to enhance performance.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: For secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB to streamline database operations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript for backend development.
